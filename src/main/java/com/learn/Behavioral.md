## Communication & Teamwork

### Tell me about a time you had to deal with a difficult colleague. How did you communicate properly?

During a group project, I worked with a team member who was consistently missing deadlines. I initiated a private
conversation to understand the underlying issues, helped them break down tasks, and established clearer communication
channels. By focusing on the shared goal rather than blame, we improved our collaboration and successfully completed the
project.

### How would you describe your ability to work as a team member?

I consider myself a collaborative team member. I prioritize clear communication, contribute actively to shared
objectives, and value the input of my colleagues. I believe in supporting team members when needed and am comfortable
both taking the lead and following direction depending on what the situation requires.

## Adaptability & Problem-Solving

### Was there a time you were given multiple tasks with critical deadlines? How did you handle it?

When faced with multiple tasks and critical deadlines, such as during the last week of every school term, I prioritize
based on urgency and importance, break down tasks into manageable components, and maintain clear communication with
teammates and stakeholders. This approach helped me balance coursework, thesis development, and internship
responsibilities simultaneously.

### Tell me about a time you took the lead in a team project. What was the outcome?

I've led several projects, including the Asset Acquisition and Notice Board projects, where I focused on clear task
distribution and progress tracking, resulting in excellent grades and successful implementation. At Dashlabs.ai, I took
the initiative to develop an HR chatbot beyond my support engineer role. For my thesis, I proposed using Flutter, which
enabled us to create an iPad-compatible application despite having a limited development system.

## Work Environment & Motivation

### What type of work environment or work culture would make you most productive and happy?

I prefer a collaborative environment that balances structure with flexibility, encourages innovation, and provides
opportunities for continuous learning. A positive and supportive team culture is also very important to me. I thrive in
environments where ideas are valued and there's a clear connection between my work and the company's broader goals.

### What do you look for in a company?

I seek a company that values innovation, offers professional development, fosters a collaborative culture, and engages
in impactful work within its industry. I'm particularly drawn to organizations like Amdocs that have a global presence
and make a real difference in how people connect and communicate.

## Work Style

### How would you describe your work style? What would your team say about your working style?

I would describe my work style as detail-oriented, proactive, and adaptable. I believe my team would describe me as
organized, reliable, and a clear communicator who contributes to a positive team environment. They might also mention my
methodical approach to problem-solving and willingness to help others when needed.

## Personal Interests

### What are your hobbies and interests outside of work?

In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, singing, playing video games, cycling, and exploring design principles. These
hobbies provide creative outlets and help me maintain a balanced perspective. I find that stepping away from code
periodically with these activities often leads to fresh insights when I return to technical challenges.

## Time Management & Productivity

### How do you handle tight deadlines?

I approach tight deadlines by first breaking down the work into manageable tasks with mini-deadlines. I prioritize
critical functionality, communicate proactively about progress, and focus intensely during work periods. This balanced
approach helped me deliver our thesis project on time despite discovering critical issues close to the deadline.

## Learning & Growth

### How do you approach learning new technologies?

I follow a structured approach that combines theory with hands-on practice. I start with documentation and tutorials to
understand fundamentals, then build increasingly complex projects to apply what I've learned. This method helped me
master Flutter/Dart in three months for our thesis project despite having no prior experience.

## Conflict Resolution

### How do you handle disagreements in a team setting?

I view disagreements as opportunities to find better solutions. I focus on understanding different perspectives, finding
common ground, and making evidence-based decisions when possible. During my Notice Board project, when my partner and I
disagreed on state management approaches, we created small prototypes of both solutions and evaluated them objectively.

## Technical Skills

### What are your strongest technical skills?

My strongest technical skills include Java programming, full-stack development (backend with Spring and frontend with
React/JavaFX), database design, and problem-solving. I maintain these skills through continuous learning, practical
application in projects, and staying current with industry trends.

## Motivation & Problem-Solving

### What motivates you in your work?

I'm motivated by solving meaningful problems that have real-world impact. I enjoy the process of creating elegant
solutions to complex challenges and seeing how my work benefits users. I also find continuous learning and professional
growth highly motivating, which is why Amdocs' focus on innovation appeals to me.

### How do you approach debugging complex issues?

I take a systematic approach to debugging by first reproducing the issue consistently, gathering information through
logs and debugging tools, formulating hypotheses about potential causes, and methodically testing each hypothesis. This
approach helped me resolve a critical data persistence issue in our thesis project.

## Code Quality

### How do you balance quality and delivery in your work?

I believe in maintaining high-quality standards while being pragmatic about deadlines. I focus on core functionality
first, ensuring it works flawlessly, then add enhancements if time permits. I also implement automated testing where
possible to catch issues early without slowing down development.

### How do you ensure your code is maintainable?

I write clean, self-documenting code with clear naming conventions and appropriate comments. I follow SOLID principles,
break down complex functions into smaller, focused methods, and conduct regular refactoring to improve design. I also
value code reviews as they help maintain consistent standards.

## Cloud & Collaboration

### What experience do you have with cloud technologies?

I've worked with Firebase for database and authentication in mobile projects and have experience with AWS services
through coursework and certifications. I understand cloud concepts like infrastructure-as-code, containerization, and
microservices architecture.

### How do you approach collaboration with non-technical stakeholders?

I focus on clear, jargon-free communication, using analogies and visual aids when helpful. I listen carefully to
understand their needs, ask questions to clarify requirements, and provide regular updates in terms that relate to their
business objectives rather than technical details. | I've applied TDD principles in my projects by writing tests before
implementation, focusing on small, testable units of functionality, and using the red-green-refactor cycle. This
approach has helped me create more robust code with fewer bugs. | |
